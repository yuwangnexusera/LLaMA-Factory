On 2022-07-16, a PET/CT scan at Tianjin Waterdrop Medical Imaging Center showed: A metabolically active nodule near the hilum of the left lower lobe of the lung (approximately 2.6Ã1.6cm), suspected lung cancer with obstructive atelectasis, multiple small nodular thickenings of the left pleura with slightly increased metabolism, suggestive of pleural metastasis accompanied by left pleural effusion; L5 vertebral body, left iliac bone, acetabulum, pubis, bilateral ischia, and the upper segment of the left femur showing bone destruction with increased metabolism, suggestive of metastasis, accompanied by swelling of soft tissues in the left hip area; high-metabolism enlarged lymph nodes at the left hilum, suggestive of metastasis; a high-metabolism soft tissue nodule in the anterior mediastinum (approximately 1.8Ã1.0cm), suggestive of metastasis; multiple lymph nodes near L5 vertebral body, along the left iliac vessels, and in the inguinal area with varying degrees of increased metabolism, not ruling out metastasis; multiple millet-sized nodules in both lungs with low metabolic activity, not ruling out metastasis. The patient was admitted for further diagnosis and treatment under the initial outpatient diagnosis of 'left lung mass'. Since the onset of illness, the patient's spirits and appetite have been fairly good, sleep poor, bowel movements normal, and weight loss of about 5 kilograms.\nHistory confirmed as true.\nPatient Signature:\nRelationship to Patient:\nSignature Date: 2022.07.22\nAdmission Diagnosis: Stage IV left lung cancer with multiple lymph node metastases, left pleural metastasis, left pleural effusion, multiple bone metastases, bilateral lung metastases not ruled out\nPage 1\nPhysician's Signature:.JSON result:",

Outpatient pulmonary CT indicated a left lower lung mass with bilateral multiple nodules and left adrenal mass. Routine blood tests showed no abnormalities. Respiratory department conducted a fiberoptic bronchoscopic biopsy, indicating adenocarcinoma in the basal segment of the left lower lobe, with genetic testing showing KRAS G12A and STK11 mutations. PET-CT showed significant FDG uptake in the left lower lobe lesion, consistent with malignant features, suggesting a high likelihood of left lung cancer, alongside clinical and pathological results. Bilateral lung nodules showed abnormally increased FDG metabolism, suggesting bilateral pulmonary metastases. The left adrenal region also showed a mass with mildly increased FDG metabolism, follow-up recommended. Bilateral cervical lymph nodes were enlarged, some with increased FDG metabolism; mediastinal, bilateral axillary, pelvic, and bilateral inguinal small lymph nodes showed no significant increase in FDG metabolism, correlating with clinical findings. Treatments included pemetrexed 0.8g ivgtt, carboplatin 500mg ivgtt, and bevacizumab 700 ivgtt every 21 days on 2023-04-20 and 2023-05-11. On 2023-05-31, ALT levels were 266 U/L, AST 141 U/L, followed by hepatoprotective treatment in our hospital. Continued original chemotherapy regimen on 2023-06-06, 07-20, and 2023-08-09.
