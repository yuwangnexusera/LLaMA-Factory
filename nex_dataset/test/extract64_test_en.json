During the course of the disease, the patient also suffered from thyroid cancer. In addition, the patient had pneumonia, hypertensive nephropathy, urogenital inflammation, Parkinson's disease, tuberculosis and other complications. In terms of genetic testing, the patient had multiple positive results, including BRCA positive, MET14 insertion positive, KRAS G213X, RET rearrangement, HER2 (ERBB2) non-20 insertion, STK11 positive, EGFR 21 positive, HER3 (ERBB3) positive, BRAF non-V600, TP53 positive and FGFR3. In addition, the patient's ECOG score was 0, TPS was 97%, and IC was 1. During the treatment, the patient used Borena as a treatment drug. However, the patient developed brain metastasis on December 8, 2022.

Pneumonia\n\n4. Hypertensive nephropathy\n\n5. Urogenital system inflammation\n\n6. Parkinson's disease\n\n7. Tuberculosis\n\nTreatment recommendations:\n\n1.

Regarding brain metastasis, the \"brain metastasis site\" in the original data is marked as \"no brain metastasis\", but the \"brain metastasis date\" has a specific date \"2022-12-08\". There may be data inconsistencies or errors here. In the optimized admission record, I retained this information, but it is recommended to further verify the accuracy of this data.\n\n2. \"Thyroid cancer\" is mentioned in \"Malignant tumor conditions\", which is listed as a diagnosis. At the same time, \"Other pathological types of non-small cell lung cancer\" is mentioned in \"Disease name\", which is the patient's main disease.\n\n3. According to the data provided, the patient's ECOG score is 0, which usually means that the patient's mobility is completely normal and can engage in daily activities without any symptoms. TPS is 97%, which may refer to the expression level of a certain marker of tumor cells, which is instructive for treatment selection in some cases.\n\n4. Regarding \"Borina\" in \"Therapeutic drug name\", this should be a therapeutic drug for the patient's specific gene mutation. Continuing treatment with this drug is also mentioned in the treatment recommendation.\n\n5. The patient's \"admission date\" is July 16, 2019, but the dates of some examinations and diagnoses are after that, which indicates that the admission record may have been gradually improved over a period of time after the patient was admitted.\n\n6. Regarding the \"record date\" is August 13, 2021, which may be the recording time of this admission record or an important data point. However, since it has no specific classification, I have included it as part of the overall record in the optimized admission record instead of listing it separately.\n\n7. All the provided data points have been reflected in the optimized admission record and organized in a logical order so that doctors can have a clearer understanding of the patient's condition and treatment.

Postoperative pathology confirmed ROS1 rearrangement, ALK rearrangement, MET fusion, BRCA2 gene positive, TP53 gene positive, STK11 gene positive, and EGFR gene detection found S768I mutation. Immunoassay showed that PDL1 expression was 50%.\nMedical observation and treatment during hospitalization: Surgery and comprehensive treatment were performed for giant cell carcinoma, and corresponding treatment and monitoring were carried out for complications.\n\nDiagnosis and treatment results:\nDiagnosis results: Confirmed as giant cell carcinoma, accompanied by interstitial pneumonia, heart failure, cataracts, hypertensive nephropathy and spinal cord compression and other diseases. Genetic testing revealed multiple gene abnormalities.\nTreatment effect: Surgery and subsequent comprehensive treatment controlled the condition and the patient recovered well.\nCondition at discharge: The patient's condition was stable and vital signs were normal.\n\nDischarge instructions:\nPrecautions after discharge: Avoid excessive fatigue, maintain good living habits, and regularly perform lung CT and related gene tests.\nMedication given: Continue to take anticancer drugs and anti-infective drugs according to the doctor's instructions.
