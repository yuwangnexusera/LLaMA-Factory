Chemotherapy and genetic testing are recommended.\nAfter discussion, the patient’s family agreed to undergo chemotherapy treatment and genetic testing to determine whether targeted drug treatment was possible, and the patient’s family was given pemetrexed + loplatin.\nCase chemotherapy (pemetrexed 0.8 intravenous infusion on the 1st day, loboplatin 50mg intravenous infusion on the 2nd day), chemotherapy was completed, and the chemotherapy response was tolerable.\nCurrent hospitalization status: The patient's response to chemotherapy was tolerable, and he is now coming to the hospital for further diagnosis and treatment for the second course of chemotherapy. The COVID-19 test was negative.\nThe outpatient patient was admitted to the hospital with \"chemotherapy for right lung adenocarcinoma\".\nSince the onset of the disease, the patient has had good energy, good appetite, normal stools, normal urine, and no significant weight loss.\nPast history: Same as the first hospitalization record\nMarital and childbearing history: same as first hospitalization record\nPersonal history: same as first hospitalization record\nMenstrual history: same as first hospitalization record\nFamily history: same as first hospitalization record\nAfter careful reading by the medical examiner, the above records are consistent with the oral description of the examiner.\nConfirmation signature of medical history presenter: Wang Qiuju\nPhysical examination\nT 36℃\nP 78 times/min\nR 19 times/min\nBP 110/62mmHg",

Two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (docetaxel/cisplatin) were started.\nSurgery was performed at Beijing Friendship Hospital on July 3, 2018. The specific surgery method is unknown. Postoperative pathology: primary lesion: 4.6*3*2cm. Right middle lobe differentiated gland\ncancer. Papillary type (about 80%), alveolar type (about 10%), micropapillary type (about 10%), some tumors are rich in mucus. The tumor did not involve the pleura. branch\nThere were 7 tracheal lymph nodes and no metastasis was found. No metastasis was found in the lymph nodes in groups 4, 7, and 10. K-RAS G121 mutation\nPostoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was started on August 10, 2018, with 4 cycles of pemetrexed + carboplatin chemotherapy, without adjuvant radiotherapy.\n2018-8-30 Lung CT re-examination at another hospital: small nodules appeared in the upper lobe of the right lung.\n2018-10-20 Lung CT reexamination at another hospital: small nodules in the upper lobe of the right lung were enlarged.\n2019-2-18 China-Japan Friendship Hospital performed the second surgery, wedge resection.

CK7(+), (Additional explanation: 5 foci can be seen underground, accompanied by mucus\nThe disease spread in the secretion and alveoli (the spread range was about 1.3cm). Because of his age, he did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy and only took traditional Chinese medicine.\n2019-4-10 Two pathology consultations at the Cancer Hospital of the Medical College: (right middle lobe mass, right upper lobe bulla, 4th, 7th, 10th, and 11th lymph node groups)\nModerately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the right middle lobe of the lung.
