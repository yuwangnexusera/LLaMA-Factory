The PET image was attenuated, corrected and reconstructed.\nAfterwards, the PET and CT images were displayed in multiple planes and multiple frames: An oval-shaped soft tissue nodule was seen in the posterior segment of the upper lobe tip of the left lung, approximately 2.7cm × 1.8cm (pulmonary\nwindow), in a shallow lobulated shape, with surrounding burrs pulling the adjacent pleura, accompanied by radioactive concentration, SUVmax14.4. The lesions are adjacent to thickened bronchovascular bundles and lobules.\nThe septa are thickened, grid changes are visible, and there is uneven mild uptake, SUVmax3.2. Multiple small soft tissue nodules were diffusely present in the remaining lungs and pleura, with no high-resolution findings.\nPick.

Activating mutations in this gene can promote abnormal cell proliferation and differentiation\nAnd blood vessel proliferation, and can inhibit the apoptosis of tumor cells. TCGA and COSMIC data show that EGFR mutations account for 10-20% of Western NSCLC. this\nThe rate is particularly high among lung adenocarcinoma patients who are East Asian, female, and have no history of smoking. The PIONEER study shows that the EGFR mutation rate in Chinese lung adenocarcinoma patients is ~50%.\nEGFR hotspot mutations are concentrated in exons 18-21 of the kinase domain.

Such patients are resistant to third-generation TKIs.\nSensitive to TKIs such as osimertinib, ametinib, and fumetinib.\nThe vast majority of EGFR 20ins (except for special subtypes A763_Y764insFQEA, etc.) are resistant to traditional first to third generation TKIs.
