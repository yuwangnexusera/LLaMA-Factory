Activating mutations in this gene can promote abnormal cell proliferation and differentiation\nAnd blood vessel proliferation, and can inhibit the apoptosis of tumor cells. TCGA and COSMIC data show that EGFR mutations account for 10-20% of Western NSCLC. this\nThe rate is particularly high among lung adenocarcinoma patients who are East Asian, female, and have no history of smoking. The PIONEER study shows that the EGFR mutation rate in Chinese lung adenocarcinoma patients is ~50%.\nEGFR hotspot mutations are concentrated in exons 18-21 of the kinase domain.

The following are the dynamic changes in the abundance of mutations unique to common ctDNA tumors, as well as their possible corresponding significance.\nExplanation, for reference only:\n(1) If no tumor-specific mutations are detected in this ctDNA sample, it may indicate that the current tumor status is relatively stable, or that current treatment measures have a certain inhibitory effect on the tumor;\nIn addition, it is also related to the location of recurrent lesions (if any);\n(2) If the abundance of tumor-specific mutations in this ctDNA sample shows a decreasing trend compared with the previous ones, it may indicate that the current treatment measures have a certain suppressive effect on tumors, or it may\nIt can indicate that the tumor is in a slow progression stage;\n(3) If the abundance of tumor-specific mutations in this ctDNA sample shows an overall higher trend than before, or new tumor-specific mutations are detected, it may indicate that the current tumor cells are more\nActive, indicating that the tumor has progressed or has become resistant to current treatment measures. Drug-resistant clones have begun to accumulate, and the treatment plan may need to be adjusted.\nThe chart only includes tumor-specific mutations in plasma ctDNA samples submitted for each test.\nPlasma ctDNA is a DNA fragment released by tumor cells into the blood.

Later, the patient's right upper arm gradually worsened, and\nFurther chest CT examination on December 25 showed: space-occupying lesions in the apical segment of the upper lobe of the right lung, and it was recommended to further examine with enhanced CT; multiple micronodules were found in both lungs.\nFurther examination is recommended: the right pleura is irregularly thickened, combined with clinical examination. Improved PET/CT on December 28 showed: 1. Nodules in the apical segment of the right upper lobe\nIf there are lesions, the metabolism is increased, and malignant lesions (peripheral lung cancer) are likely to be considered; 2. The lymph nodes in the muscle space of the right anterior chest wall, the metabolism is increased, and lymph nodes are considered.\nNode metastasis is highly likely; 3. Multiple nodules under the right pleura, multiple nodular thickenings in the pleura, and increased metabolism should consider the possibility of pleural metastasis.\nLarge; 4. Micronodules in both lungs, with no abnormalities in metabolism, the possibility of metastases to the lungs is considered high; 5. The 10th thoracic vertebrae and accessory bones, and the 10th posterior rib on the left\nThe bone density is uneven and the metabolism is increased, so the possibility of bone metastases is high; 6.

In longitudinal surveillance, 89.1% of MRD-positive patients experienced relapse.\nThe recurrence was detected on average 3.4 months earlier than imaging.

Pressure volume-pressure flow rate measurement:\n1 Supine position, No. 9 bladder pressure tube, infusion speed 50ml/min, no inhibitory contraction wave of detrusor during filling phase, no urine discharge\nout. The initial urge to urinate was 193ml, and the strong urge to urinate was 496ml. When the filling reaches 200ml, ask the patient to cough and gradually increase the pressure to perform Valsalva maneuver.\nNo leakage of urine from the urethral opening was observed. When the maximum filling reaches 509ml, the patient feels bloated. Ask the patient to urinate actively, and the urination period will be long\nAfter waiting for time and changing the sitting position, abdominal pressure will help the maximum detrusor pressure increase by about 11-24cmH2O, and a small amount of urine can be seen being discharged.\n2. The sensory sensitivity of the bladder increases during the filling phase, and slightly decreases during the micturition phase. The compliance is acceptable, and the maximum cystometry capacity is approximately normal.\n. No detrusor inhibitory contraction wave was seen during the filling phase. Long waiting and changing of sitting positions during urination. Abdominal pressure assisted in maximizing detrusor pressure.\nThe increase is about 11-24cmH2O, and a small amount of urine can be seen.

Therefore, ctDNA detection can stably identify MRD in localized lung cancer,\nPostoperative ctDNA detection for prediction of recurrence risk in a clinical trial of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (TRACERx)\n4/12\nA total of 24 patients were included in the value study, among which the recurrence rate in the ctDNA-positive group was 93% (13/14), and the recurrence rate in the ctDNA-negative group was 93% (13/14).\nThe incidence rate is 10% (1/10). ctDNA dynamic detection can analyze the subclonal evolution of recurrent NSCLC and evaluate adjuvant therapy.\nIn a retrospective study of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, follow-up blood samples of 65 patients who received radical chemoradiotherapy were analyzed.\nPlasma ctDNA was analyzed, and 28 patients received consolidation immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapy. The study showed that radical radiotherapy\nPatients with no ctDNA detected after chemotherapy treatment have a better prognosis and no progression rate regardless of whether they receive ICI consolidation therapy or not.\n(FFP) had no significant difference, but patients with detected ctDNA who received ICI consolidation therapy were less likely to receive ICI consolidation therapy than those who did not receive ICI consolidation therapy.\nThose with better FRP; In addition, the change trend of ctDNA in the early stage of ICI consolidation therapy reflects the effect of consolidation therapy.\nResponding patients. Therefore, patients with MRD-positive NSCLC can benefit from consolidation immunotherapy, and ctDNA detection\nIn a prospective clinical study of patients with stage I-Ill operable lung cancer, a total of 261 NSCLC patients were included.\nThere were 104 stage IA patients, 59 stage IB patients, 53 stage || patients, and 45 stage III patients; analyzed by MRD.\n913 peripheral blood samples were successfully tested. Among patients who remained MRD negative during longitudinal surveillance, only 6 patients (3.2%)\nWhen recurrence occurs, 96.8% of patients maintain recurrence-free survival, thus defining a potentially curable population. MRD positive\nThe peak period occurs 18 months after surgery, and the risk gradually decreases thereafter. In longitudinal surveillance, 89.1% of MRD-positive patients experienced recurrence.\nThe recurrence was detected on average 3.4 months earlier than imaging. Patients with isolated brain metastasis recurrence are less likely to be monitored by MRD\n(n=1/5, 20%). Therefore, the study further confirmed the prognostic value of MRD detection in operable lung cancer, especially\nFor people who continue to remain MRD negative, they may represent a potentially cured group of people regardless of clinical stage.\nNote: The prognostic tips of MRD are based on existing clinical research reports.
