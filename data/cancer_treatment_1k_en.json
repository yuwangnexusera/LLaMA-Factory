Multiple reexaminations showed that the lung and brain lesions had been alleviated. On December 8, 2020, cranial MRI showed multiple metastases in the bilateral cerebrum and right cerebellum, and some lesions were slightly enlarged. Chest CT showed that the lesions in the right middle lobe of the lung were stable, and the right hilar lymph nodes were slightly smaller than before. On December 27, 2020, the MRI of the head showed that the condition was basically similar to the previous one; the local enhanced nodules on the skin and subcutaneous part of the head were slightly more obvious than before. The third cycle of chemotherapy began on June 7, 2021, using bevacizumab, pemetrexed and carboplatin. From March 6, 2021, the patient switched to oral osimertinib. On March 29, 2021, the enhanced MRI of the brain showed that the condition of the scalp and subcutaneous nodules was basically maintained, but the multiple metastases in the bilateral brain and right cerebellum were larger than before. On April 28, 2021, radiotherapy was started at Beijing Swelling Hospital, involving brain metastases. On May 9, 2021, the second cycle of bevacizumab + pemetrexed + carboplatin chemotherapy was performed. The results of the chest CT scan on June 1, 2021 showed that the right middle lobe of the lung had a mass with distal obstructive changes similar to the previous time, and the condition of multiple metastatic lymph nodes in the right hilum and left supraclavicular part of the mediastinum remained unchanged. On July 14, 2021, chest CT showed that the right middle lobe mass with distal obstructive changes was roughly the same as before. Bevacizumab treatment was switched to on July 15, 2021, and on September 27, 2021, it was changed to afatinib 40mg once a day.

The patient underwent immunological testing 5 years ago (May 2018) and was diagnosed with lung cancer. Subsequently, a pathological examination was performed on October 13, 2018, confirming that the pathological types were carcinosarcoma and lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma. The results of genetic testing showed that BRAF was positive, KRAS contained G13D mutation and was positive, HER3 (ERBB3) was positive, KEAP1 was positive, RET test results were insertion-positive, EGFR was positive, ROS1 detected G3032R point mutation, and FGFR test was FGFR2 fusion-positive. The patient received treatment for the first time on November 8, 2019, including drug therapy and radiotherapy, and started treatment on December 31, 2019, using drugs Gefitinib for lung cancer. However, because the patient's physical condition score (ECOG) was 5, that is, he was completely unable to take care of himself and his life was completely dependent on others, the treatment progress was not ideal. Based on the evaluation, no further treatment drugs were recommended starting from April 6, 2020, to November 30, 2022. Unfortunately, we learned that the patient had brain metastases on January 15, 2024, including metastases to the brain and cerebellum. In addition, the patient has certain complications, including endocrine and immune system diseases such as Kawasaki disease, eye, ear, nose and throat related diseases such as macular edema, genitourinary system diseases such as severe renal insufficiency, infectious diseases such as AIDS, neurological diseases such as bipolar disorder, respiratory diseases such as hemothorax, digestive system diseases such as esophageal varices, and circulatory system diseases such as dysplasia. The patient's disease was first diagnosed on March 22, 2021, and he underwent his first lung resection on May 6, 2021. The treatment lasted until January 26, 2020, and the patient showed a certain degree of malignancy, thyroid cancer. In summary, the patient's lung cancer is complicated and has developed to the late stage, accompanied by multi-organ metastasis and multiple complications. At present, the patient needs to be admitted to the hospital for continued comprehensive treatment and disease monitoring. Considering the patient's age, physical condition and disease progression, the treatment plan needs to be evaluated in detail to select the treatment method that best suits the patient's condition.json output:",

Therefore, ctDNA testing can stably identify MRD in localized lung cancer, thus providing the possibility of personalized adjuvant therapy during the period when the tumor burden is very small.\n\nMedication history:\n2022-06 to 2022-08, carboplatin + pemetrexed\n2023-03, atezolizumab\nIn a clinical study (TRACERx) for early non-small cell lung cancer, a total of 24 patients were included in the study of the recurrence risk prediction value of postoperative ctDNA detection, of which the recurrence rate of the ctDNA-positive group was 93% (13/14) and the recurrence rate of the ctDNA-negative group was 10% (1/10). Dynamic detection of ctDNA can analyze the subclonal evolution of recurrent NSCLC, evaluate the response to adjuvant therapy, and provide guidance for personalized treatment before clinical recurrence.\n\nResponse, provide guidance for personalized treatment before clinical recurrence (PMID: 28445469). In a retrospective study of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, follow-up plasma ctDNA was analyzed in 65 patients who received radical chemoradiotherapy, of which 28 patients received consolidation immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapy. The study showed that patients with no ctDNA detected after radical chemoradiotherapy had a better prognosis regardless of whether they received ICI consolidation therapy, and there was no significant difference in the progression-free rate.

        "input": "Admission and discharge records:\n\nPatient Zhao Jun, medical record number 10312, was admitted to the outpatient department of the Department of Thoracic Oncology, Peking University Cancer Hospital on October 17, 2023. The main complaint was adenocarcinoma of the left upper lobe with brain metastasis for more than 2 years. The current medical history shows that the patient had shortness of breath and coughing up bloody sputum for more than 2 months. Past medical history shows that on November 29, 2022, a CT scan at an external hospital found a mass in the left upper lobe of the lung, accompanied by a little obstructive inflammation. The lesion may surround the left pulmonary artery hepatic trunk and some of its branches. At the same time, there are scattered solid nodules in both lungs, which are considered to be metastatic. There is mild emphysema, slightly larger lymph nodes in the mediastinum and left hilum, and local thickening of the left pleura. On December 9, 2022, the pathological consultation of Peking Union Medical College determined that it was a tumor cell in the left upper lobe of the lung, and squamous cell carcinoma was not excluded. On January 7, 2023, an enhanced MRI of the head at an external hospital showed possible metastasis in the right frontal lobe and left temporal lobe cortex and medulla. On 2023-02-02, the patient was diagnosed with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma by left lung puncture. No mutation was found in blood gene testing, and PD-L1 (SP263) expression was low. Tissue gene testing showed EGFR21 L858R positive, PIK3CA positive, and MET amplification. The patient started oral Conmena on 2023-03-12, and then started Conmena combined with Cervotinib on 2023-05-21. On 2023-07-19, the external hospital reexamination of chest enhanced CT showed that the left upper lobe tumor was slightly reduced, the small nodules in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe were reduced, the density of the small nodules in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe and the lingular segment of the left upper lobe was reduced, and no effusion was found in the left pleural cavity. On 2023-07-21, the head enhanced MRI showed that the size of the right frontal lobe nodule was 8.9 mm. Subsequently, Conmena combined with Gumetinib was started on 2023-07-21. The most recent examination on 2023-10-12 showed that the tumor from the left hilum to the left upper lobe was generally stable, the small nodules in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe were slightly enlarged, and the nodules in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe were slightly reduced. The patient's current purpose of visiting the doctor is to consult the next treatment plan.\n\nDoctor Zhao Jun, the medical history collected on 2021-04-02 showed that he had papillary adenocarcinoma. The specific gene test results showed that STK11 was positive, RET was rearranged, MET was overexpressed in c-MET, and RB1 was positive. The patient was born on 1966-08-02, the date of admission was 2020-04-28, and the treatment ended on 2021-01-22. json result:",

On December 4, PET-CT was performed in our hospital. It showed: a solid mass in the left upper lobe of the lung, with increased metabolism, which was considered lung cancer; multiple nodules in the remaining lungs and pleural surfaces, with increased metabolism, which was considered intrapulmonary metastasis; multiple thickening of the left pleura with increased metabolism, which was considered metastasis; increased metabolism in the strip of the left lower chest wall, the nature of which was to be determined; multiple lymph nodes in the mediastinum (4L, 5, 7 areas), left hilum, and left pericardial septum group, with increased metabolism, which was considered metastasis; small lymph nodes in the mediastinum 4R, 6 areas, with mild increased metabolism, tended to be mainly granulomatous lesions; bilateral lock Small lymph nodes scattered in the supraspinal area and deep cervical group, some with mild metabolic activity, the nature of which is to be determined; metastasis to the left 6th rib and lumbar vertebral body, with increased metabolism; local density of the sacrum decreased, focal metabolism increased in the right wing of the sacrum, also tending to be metastatic; diffuse metabolism increased in the middle and upper rectum, poor local intestinal expansion, slight thickening of the intestinal wall, the nature of which is to be determined; multiple lymph nodes around the intestinal tract and in the presacral area, with mild increased metabolism, the nature of which is to be determined; multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum, some with mild increased metabolism; thickening of the left adrenal medial branch, with increased metabolism, alert for metastasis. Color Doppler ultrasound-guided puncture of the left supraclavicular lymph node; pathology showed a small number of adenocarcinoma cells, but immunohistochemistry and gene testing were not performed due to too little tissue. Adenocarcinoma cells were found in the left upper lobe of the lung under CT guidance. On December 14, 2020 and January 4, 2021, the first and second cycles of pemetrexed + cisplatin chemotherapy were given respectively (drugs: pemetrexed 1.0g, did cisplatin 50mg, d1-3, Q21d), and zoledronic acid treatment was given. Genetic testing report on January 4, 2021: showed deletion mutation of exon 19 of EGFR gene. On January 28, 2021, due to the epidemic, he was unable to return to Beijing, and received the third cycle of pemetrexed + cisplatin chemotherapy (specifically pemetrexed disodium 1000mg d1 + cisplatin 50mg d1-3) at a local hospital, and began oral targeted therapy with icotinib hydrochloride (125mg tid) on February 5. On March 26, 2021, our hospital received the fourth cycle of pemetrexed + cisplatin chemotherapy (specifically pemetrexed disodium 1000mg d1 + cisplatin 50mg d1-3 treatment), and gave zoledronic acid treatment, with no obvious discomfort. The efficacy evaluation of 3 cycles was PR. On March 19, 2021, our hospital received the fifth cycle of treatment: pemetrexed disodium 10g, d1\\\ncisplatin 50mg, d1-3, ivgtt, Q21, icotinib 125mg tid, and zoledronic acid treatment. After chemotherapy, the patient had obvious vomiting and fatigue, and grade III bone marrow suppression, which improved after symptomatic treatment and maintained PR after 5 cycles of efficacy evaluation. The patient had bilateral lower limb eyelid edema after angiography, and improved after anti-allergic treatment. The patient had obvious nausea and vomiting after 5 cycles of chemotherapy. On April 13, 2021, the sixth cycle of chemotherapy was performed, and the regimen was adjusted to: pemetrexed disodium 1.0g, d1+carboplatin 500mg, d2, ivgtt, Q21, icotinib 125mg tid. The patient still complained of obvious nausea and vomiting after 6 cycles of chemotherapy, so the regimen was adjusted on May 7, 2021: pemetrexed disodium lg, ivgtt, d1, Q21d, icotinib 125mg, po, tid/Q3W. On May 28, 2021, the original regimen was continued for the eighth cycle of treatment. On June 25, 2021, targeted therapy with bevacizumab combined with icotinib was started: bevacizumab 500mg\nivgtt d1/Q28d + icotinib 125mg tid. The efficacy of the CT reexamination during the period was evaluated as SD. On June 14, 2022, CT: solid tumor in the left upper lobe of the lung, with extremely irregular shape, some layers are slightly fuller than before, and the current size is about 3.4×2.4cm, with multiple burrs on the edge and more blurred than before, and multiple metastatic nodules in both lungs and pleura, some of which are similar to the previous ones, and some are slightly larger than before. Considering the progression of the disease, the treatment plan was changed on June 20, 2022: pemetrexed 1.0g dl + bevacizumab 500mg dl + osimertinib 80mg qd po/Q28d. On February 10, 2023, it was adjusted to pemetrexed + anlotinib + osimertinib treatment. On May 9, 2023, pemetrexed was suspended due to intolerance of adverse reactions.

The main complaint is right lung adenocarcinoma 16 years after surgery, lung metastasis targeted treatment.\n\nMedical history:\n\nThe patient underwent right lung adenocarcinoma surgery in 2007, postoperative pathology was adenocarcinoma, and the genetic test result was EGFR 21 mutation. A small nodule was found in the left upper lobe during a chest CT examination in December 2014, and the genetic test result was EGFR 21 L858 mutation. Regular follow-up was stable thereafter. However, during the follow-up in April 2020, it was found that the left lung nodule was enlarged, and metastasis was considered, and oral Conmana was started. One month later, the left lung nodule was smaller and the rash was obvious. However, oral Conmana combined with apatinib treatment was started in February 2021, and the lesion was smaller after a review one month later. At present, the lung lesions are stable and the right adrenal lesions are progressing.\n\nMedical data:\n\nAccording to the data provided, the malignant tumor is non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; the pathological date is 2021-07-29; RET fusion; the first diagnosis date of the disease is 2021-09-02; the date of brain metastasis is 2021-03-21; the endocrine and immune system diseases are diabetes; the nervous system diseases are spinal cord compression; the digestive system diseases are tuberculosis; MET overexpression; RB1 positive; the specific treatment methods for tumors are anti-vascular targeted therapy and endocrine therapy, etc.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nBased on the patient's condition, the following recommendations are made:\n\n1. If the patient's left upper lung lesion progresses, apatinib and osimertinib oral treatment can be considered for review after one month. A thoracic surgeon can be consulted to consider palliative resection of the left lung lesion.\n\n2.

The disease was first identified through imaging on August 23, 2020, showing a high-density nodule shadow in the middle bronchus of the right lung, a group shadow of the right lower hilum, accompanied by obstructive inflammation of the right lower lobe of the lung, multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, suggesting malignant potential. A subsequent bronchoscopy on October 27, 2020, supported a diagnosis of small cell lung cancer. Seven cycles of chemotherapy alongside traditional Chinese medicine treatments resulted in a reduction of the lesion, warranting regular reexaminations.\n\nIn June 2023, a mass in the right lower abdomen was detected. A CT scan on July 22, 2023, revealed thickening of the ascending colon wall and a mass adjacent to it, with potential lymphoma or metastatic tumor, including enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and pelvic effusion. A biopsy suggested a tendency toward metastatic small cell carcinoma. A repeat abdominal CT on September 12, 2023, identified a right lower abdominal mass measuring 80x58mm, involving the right ureter and potentially originating from the intestine. Surgery on September 24, 2023, confirmed the presence of cancer cells in the abdominal effusion but the lesion was deemed inoperable.\n\nMedical history includes infectious tuberculosis and a genetic profile with non-20 and 20 insertions in HER2(ERBB2), positive HER3(ERBB3), KEAP1 positivity, and a ROS1 point mutation.

The patient underwent surgery for right lung adenocarcinoma in another hospital in 2007. The postoperative stage was stage I. Postoperative pathology showed adenocarcinoma, and genetic testing showed EGFR 21 mutation. In December 2014, a small nodule in the left upper lobe was found during a follow-up examination. Genetic testing showed EGFR 21 L858 mutation, and the condition was stable after regular follow-up examinations. In November 2019, the left lung nodule increased in size. In April 2020, a follow-up examination showed that the nodule further increased and fused. It was considered to be a metastatic lesion. Oral Conmena was started. The nodule became smaller and a rash appeared during the follow-up examination. A follow-up examination in September 2020 showed that the lesion had slightly increased in size, and then oral Conmena combined with apatinib was used for treatment. The lesion was smaller after a month of follow-up examination.\n\nThe patient also received cancer treatment between September 5, 2020, and March 11, 2021, targeting liver metastasis through surgical intervention. Specific tumor treatment methods included immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy, focusing on addressing the metastatic sites and enhancing the overall treatment efficacy.\n\nThe medication was continued until January 2022, and the follow-up examination showed that the condition was stable. From January 2022, he started taking osimertinib orally. By February 2023, he had taken osimertinib orally for 1 year. No metastasis was found in the head MRI, and the lung lesions were stable. As of October 2023, the condition was still stable, and it was recommended to continue to consult for follow-up treatment plans.\nThe patient had a history of hypertension, no history of allergies, and an unknown family history. According to the Hofu TNM staging, he was diagnosed with postoperative targeted treatment of right lung adenocarcinoma (EGFR 21 L858R mutation), lung metastasis and right adrenal metastasis.\nRecommendations:\n1. For left upper lung progression, apatinib and osimertinib can be considered for oral resection after one month. You can also consult a thoracic surgeon to consider palliative resection of the left lung lesion.\n2. For local lesions in the right adrenal gland, SBRT treatment can be considered.\nIn terms of medical data, the patient also has respiratory diseases such as pulmonary edema, eye, ear, nose and throat related diseases such as conjunctivitis and eye stones, and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis.

These gene abnormalities are closely related to the patient's condition, treatment plan and prognosis.\n\nDuring the treatment, the patient received ablation therapy, and the first treatment was on April 29, 2021. Additionally, the patient underwent cancer treatment starting from 2020-09-27. The specific tumor treatment method employed was stem cell transplantation, along with the administration of the drug Fludarabine. The cancer treatment concluded on 2021-02-13. At the same time, the patient's hypertensive nephropathy, hepatitis A and macular degeneration were given corresponding treatment and management. However, the patient developed symptoms of mental illness during the treatment, and we intervened and treated him in time.\n\nDischarge diagnosis:\n\n1. Squamous cell carcinoma in situ (NUT cancer)\n\n2. Hypertensive nephropathy\n\n3. Hepatitis A\n\n4. Macular degeneration\n\n5. Mental illness\n\nCondition at discharge:\nThe patient's condition is relatively stable at present, and the effect of ablation and cancer treatments needs further observation. The symptoms of mental illness have been initially controlled, but they still need to be closely monitored. The patient and his family understand and accept the treatment and management after discharge.\n\nDischarge doctor's instructions:\n\n1. Pay attention to rest, avoid excessive fatigue, and maintain good living habits.\n\n2. Take medicine regularly according to the doctor's instructions, and do not stop or change the dosage on your own.\n\n3.

Considering the patient's specific condition, we developed a treatment plan for radical resection of the left lower lobe tumor. The operation was successfully completed on 2022-11-25. During the operation, the tumor size was about 1.5cm, completely removed, with little bleeding during the operation, and no other abnormalities were found. The patient recovered well after the operation without complications.\n\nAt the same time, according to the patient's genetic test results, we found that the patient had special conditions such as KRAS (Q61L) gene mutation and HER4 (ERBB4) positivity. These results suggest that patients may have differences in treatment and prognosis, and need close attention and individualized treatment. Based on these findings, the patient underwent a Treatment Drug Plan commencing on 2020-08-14. The plan included the administration of anlotinib, pemigatinib, and bevacizumab. The treatment concluded on 2021-01-20, with the patient responding well to the therapy.\n\nComorbid Disease:\nThe patient has a history of Meniere's Disease and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, as indicated by discharge diagnosis.\n\nDischarge:\nThe patient recovered well after surgery, his vital signs were stable, and his cough and chest pain symptoms improved significantly. The results of the reexamination imaging examination showed that the surgical site recovered well and no obvious abnormalities were found. Combined with the pathological examination (pathological date: 2021-11-04) and other related examination results, the final diagnosis was invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma of the left lower lobe of the lung, and the score is awaiting further evaluation.\n\nDischarge instructions:\n1. After discharge, patients need to continue to pay attention to rest, strengthen nutrition, and improve immunity;\n2. It is recommended to review tumor markers (including CEA, CA125, etc.) every three months to monitor tumor recurrence or metastasis;\n3. According to the results of genetic testing, it is recommended that patients pay close attention to the efficacy and side effects of related drugs in subsequent treatment and adjust the treatment plan in time;\n4. If you feel uncomfortable or find abnormal conditions, please seek medical attention in time.\n\nOthers:\nThank you for the cooperation and trust of the patient during the treatment in our hospital. We will continue to pay attention to the patient's recovery and provide necessary medical support and help.\n\nDoctor's signature: Zheng Jing\nHospital name: Hospitaljson output:",

The patient has a history of multi-system chronic diseases such as chronic bronchitis, coronary heart disease, multiple sclerosis, infectious nervous system diseases and renal cysts. She has a history of breast cancer and was treated from June 17, 2019 to July 6, 2019. The patient was diagnosed with brain metastasis on January 14, 2021, and the specific metastatic sites included the brain stem. An additional brain metastasis site was noted on July 19, 2022, though the specific site remains unknown. This admission was for continued treatment and optimization of the treatment. The patient underwent a puncture on March 13, 2022. The surgical site was liver metastasis, and pathological diagnosis was pulmonary blastoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma. The specific treatment method for the patient's tumor is targeted drug therapy, and the first treatment time is February 6, 2023. The immunoassay was performed on October 27, 2018. The results showed that HER4 (ERBB4) was positive, HER3 (ERBB3) was positive, TP53 was positive, KEAP1 was positive, KRAS mutation was G213, BRAF was positive, HER2 (ERBB2) was 20 insertion, EGFR had exon 19 insertion mutation and other rare mutations, MET had MET14 skipping and other rare mutations. FGFR gene testing showed point mutations and gene fusions. The NTRK gene family test results were positive, and the specific classification included NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3. Fusion, point mutations and rearrangements were observed in these genes. ROS1 gene was positive. Immunohistochemistry test results showed that the tumor cell positive ratio (TPS) was 10%, the cell positive score (CPS) was 20%, and the immune cell ratio (IC) was 5%. According to the patient's pathological examination results and the positive molecular markers, targeted targeted therapy drugs are considered to improve the treatment effect. The treatment will be based on the patient's molecular marker characteristics and clinical guidelines, and drugs targeting gene targets such as EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, and MET will be selected. In summary, the patient was diagnosed with lung cancer with multiple gene mutations. His current condition is stable. A treatment plan will be formulated in accordance with the latest clinical guidelines and the patient's genotyping results. Dr. Zhang Qi will be the main doctor.json output:",

After detailed medical evaluation and examination, Mr. Wang was diagnosed with NUT cancer and squamous adenocarcinoma. According to the patient's specific situation, the medical team conducted a multidisciplinary consultation and developed a comprehensive treatment plan, including targeted therapy and chemotherapy. During the hospitalization, Mr. Wang's condition was relatively stable and did not deteriorate significantly. Mr. Wang began to receive targeted therapy and chemotherapy on November 5, 2021, and underwent lung resection on December 25, 2021. The purpose of the operation was mainly to locally remove the tumor to relieve symptoms. The pathology report confirmed the diagnosis of the surgical site. Throughout the treatment, the tumor volume has shrunk, but there are still residual lesions.\n\nTreatment measures and effects:\nMr. Wang has received systematic targeted therapy and chemotherapy since November 5, 2021, and underwent lung resection on December 25, 2021. The overall condition has been effectively controlled and the tumor volume has been significantly reduced. Mr. Wang's genetic test results showed EGFR positive, HER3 (ERBB3) positive, STK11 positive, TP53 positive, and other rare mutations in MET. These genetic markers help to further refine the treatment plan. Unfortunately, RET is missing, which may affect the choice of certain treatment strategies.\n\nDischarge diagnosis:\n- Main diagnosis: NUT cancer, squamous adenocarcinoma, stable condition\n- Secondary diagnosis: pleomorphic carcinoma\n\nDischarge instructions:\nAfter discharge, Mr. Wang needs to continue regular checkups and adjust the treatment plan according to changes in his condition. It is recommended to continue taking medication as prescribed by the doctor and to have regular checkups (checkup cycle: once every 3 months). At the same time, attention should be paid to monitoring and preventing possible complications such as infection and thrombosis. Professional follow-up plans will continue to be provided by our hospital team.\n\nFor home care, it is recommended that Mr. Wang and his family pay special attention to diet and nutrition, maintain adequate rest, and maintain a positive attitude. The home hygiene environment should be kept clean to prevent cross-infection.\n\nThe above is a detailed record of Mr. Wang's hospitalization. I hope that Mr. Wang can strictly follow the doctor's advice and actively cooperate with subsequent treatment and follow-up. I hope that his condition will continue to improve and he will recover soon. json result:",

Gray-white tissue with a diameter of about 0.2cm was found in the right upper lobe of the lung. It was diagnosed as lung adenocarcinoma, mainly solid growth. A high metabolic mass appeared in the right upper lobe of the lung, which grew outward across the oblique fissure. It was considered to be lung cancer, accompanied by atelectasis. Multiple lymph node metastases in the mediastinum 2R, 3P, and 7 groups, and right pleural effusion. On October 14, 2016, genetic testing showed exon 21 mutations, and targeted drug Conmena could be used for treatment. After one month of treatment, the tumor shrank from 6 cm to 4 cm, but liver function was impaired. Bone metastasis treatment was performed on May 16, 2018, and targeted therapy was continued. No new lesions were found in the reexamination on May 30, 2018. On June 21, 2019, a chest CT scan in our hospital showed that the soft tissue mass in the right upper lobe of the lung was slightly larger than before, the right pleural effusion was slightly reduced, and there were multiple bone destructions in the thoracic spine and bilateral ribs, which were considered to be metastases. There were multiple low-enhancement nodules in the spleen, the tumor marker CEA increased slightly, and CA125 and CA199 decreased slightly. The patient was in good general condition and had no discomfort. On July 9, 2019, a cranial MRI was performed at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University, showing lesions in the right parietal lobe and left frontal lobe. Combined with the medical history, it was considered to be a metastatic tumor. On December 25, 2019, local radiotherapy was started in the radiotherapy department, SBRT 95% PGTV1, 3mm three-dimensional expansion of the left frontal lobe lesion, 28Gy/2 times; 95% PGTV2, 3mm three-dimensional expansion of the right occipital lobe lesion, 52Gy/8 times. Brain radiotherapy ended on October 6, 2020. Treatment ended on April 12, 2021. CT examination on April 17, 2020 showed that the right upper lobe cancer, a small amount of pleural effusion on the right side, and scattered small patchy nodules in both lungs were not significantly changed compared with the previous changes; multiple metastatic destruction of the thoracic spine and bilateral ribs, some of which were new; diffuse low-density lesions in the spleen were scanned. On April 21, 2020, the head MRI showed that the structures of the bilateral cerebral hemispheres were roughly symmetrical, and double abnormal enhancement nodules of about 6mm were seen in the left frontal lobe and right parietal lobe, with flake edema areas around the lesions; double abnormal enhancement nodules with edema in the left frontal lobe and right parietal lobe were considered metastasis. The brain MRI on August 27, 2020 showed that the metastatic nodules in the left frontal lobe and right parietal lobe were slightly enlarged (increased by 2mm), and the peritumoral edema was slightly more obvious than before. The right frontal lobe enhancement focus was also considered a metastatic focus. The comparison between the brain MRI on November 30, 2020 and the head MRI on August 27, 2020 showed that the bilateral abnormal enhancement nodules in the frontal lobe and right parietal lobe were enlarged, the larger one was about 8mm, and now it is about 9x7mm. The brain MRI on June 15, 2021 showed that the multiple metastases in the brain were enlarged, and the range of peritumoral edema was enlarged. The patient had no symptoms related to cranial and brain metastasis, and the patient refused to actively undergo anti-tumor treatment.

On March 2, 2020, he underwent surgery for adenosquamous carcinoma of the left upper lobe of the lung and was in stage IB. He then underwent 6 cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin and lobaplatin, and then rested. In April 2021, due to enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, he underwent 6 cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin combined with pemetrexed, and then received mediastinal radiotherapy at a local hospital. Genetic testing showed EGFR20 insertion mutation. On January 11, 2022, multiple new solid nodules were found in both lungs, of which the larger ones had large and small metastases to be excluded, and there were no signs of metastasis in the brain. After hormone treatment, chest enhanced CT showed that some small nodules shrank and disappeared, metastases to be excluded, and the left pleural effusion decreased.\n\nMDT recommended a re-examination of chest CT, which needs to be combined with preoperative CT comparison, and the possibility of a second primary is not ruled out. Hormone treatment is currently continuing and gradually reduced. Radiotherapy is expected to end in April 2022, and no targeted therapy has been performed. Recently, our hospital's PET-CT showed that there was no high metabolism in the postoperative bronchial stump of the left upper lobe, and no high metabolism in multiple small nodules in both lungs. Follow-up is recommended. In addition, multiple rib fractures were found, some of which were accompanied by high metabolism. Please consult in combination with clinical conditions. The ribs are not considered to be metastatic for the time being, and the left lung lesions are not considered to be recurrent. Radiotherapy is expected to end in July. No abnormalities were found in cranial MRI and color ultrasound, and no abnormalities were found in chest and abdominal CT.\n\nThe most recent review showed that there was no tumor recurrence in chest, abdominal CT, brain MRI, and supraclavicular B-ultrasound. Genetic testing results showed EGFR20 insertion mutation in tissue specimens, and PDL1 expression was 90%. The outpatient diagnosis was stage IB postoperative left lung adenocarcinoma, secondary renal malignant tumor, and brain metastasis. The treatment plan is mainly medical drug treatment, considering elective SRS for intracranial metastases, and SBRT for renal metastases if necessary. json results:",

Genetic testing showed EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation. PET/CT examination revealed multiple metastases, including no high metabolic foci at the bronchial stump after left upper lobectomy, new diffuse multiple nodules in both lungs, mild diffuse increase in metabolism in both lungs, which was considered to be multiple metastases in both lungs, new thickening of multiple interlobular septa in the right lung, and new small effusions in the bilateral chest and pericardium. Metastatic lymph nodes were newly found in the 7th area of ​​the mediastinum and the right hilum. After that, the patient began to be enrolled in a clinical trial (TAK788) and was treated with pemetrexed + carboplatin. The patient was reviewed regularly for chest enhanced CT, and then thrombolytic therapy was performed. During this period, the disease progressed, and oral TAK788 was started on XXXX-XX. After taking the medicine, symptoms such as increased blood pressure, oral metoprolol, small reddish rashes on the outer thighs and chest and back, and ALT briefly increased to 71 and then returned to normal after oral liver protection drugs. The patient's condition is currently stable, and he continues to take oral targeted therapy with vometinib.\n\nExamination results: The patient's ALT is 2740, AST is 1440; severe liver function damage. Recent chest CT examinations showed that the metastatic lesions in both lungs were slightly enlarged, and there was no obvious change in pleural effusion. The head MRI showed that the brain metastasis caused the same as before.\n\nDiagnosis: Left upper lobe adenocarcinoma, brain and lung metastasis, bone metastasis, EGFR20+, targeted therapy\n\nTreatment: Continue to take vometinib 160mg qd for 2 months, and recheck chest CT plain scan, abdominal and supraclavicular cervical lymph node color Doppler ultrasound and other examinations. Blood routine and biochemical full set are reviewed every month during medication.\n\nRecommendation: Considering the patient's slow progression of the disease, it is recommended to continue observation and strengthen drug treatment. If further treatment is required, denosumab injection can be considered for treatment.

He had a history of hypertension and denied a history of diabetes and coronary heart disease. He was first diagnosed with lung cancer on February 15, 2020. The patient underwent a pathological biopsy on October 18, 2021 and was diagnosed with adenosquamous lung carcinoma. Since the diagnosis, the patient has received a series of treatments, including lung surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The patient's disease progression showed brain metastasis on April 2, 2022, so whole-brain radiotherapy was performed. At admission, the patient's ECOG score was 5, indicating that the patient was completely unable to take care of himself, completely bedridden, and needed help from others for life activities. The patient's tumor marker PD-L1 expression level was measured at 8%, TPS was 10%, and CPS was 5%, suggesting that immunotherapy may have a certain effect. The patient's molecular marker test showed EGFR mutation (G719A, L858R), ALK positive, and KRAS G12V positive, suggesting the possibility of targeted therapy, but further discussion is needed to select a suitable treatment plan. In addition, the patient also has NTRK1, and the molecular types are fusion, point mutation, and rearrangement, which may be another option for targeted therapy. For these molecular-specific lesions, we plan to apply third-generation TKI drugs targeting EGFR mutations and consider combining with immunotherapy. The patient's current systemic condition is poor. After admission, he will first receive nutritional and supportive treatment to improve his overall condition and prepare for subsequent treatment. As comorbidities, atelectasis and uremia will bring certain challenges to treatment. Our medical team will closely monitor the patient's condition and deal with possible complications in a timely manner.

Perform imaging examinations regularly to monitor tumor changes and evaluate treatment effects.\n\nDiagnostic doctor: Qin Xin\n\nThe above admission records have been supplemented and optimized based on the medical data provided to provide more complete and rich information about the patient's condition and treatment\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Regarding brain metastasis, the \"brain metastasis site\" in the original data is marked as \"no brain metastasis\", but the \"brain metastasis date\" has a specific date \"2022-12-08\". There may be data inconsistencies or errors here. In the optimized admission record, I retained this information, but it is recommended to further verify the accuracy of this data.\n\n2. \"Thyroid cancer\" is mentioned in \"Malignant tumor conditions\", which is listed as a diagnosis. At the same time, \"Other pathological types of non-small cell lung cancer\" is mentioned in \"Disease name\", which is the patient's main disease.\n\n3. According to the data provided, the patient's ECOG score is 0, which usually means that the patient's mobility is completely normal and can engage in daily activities without any symptoms. TPS is 97%, which may refer to the expression level of a certain marker of tumor cells, which is instructive for treatment selection in some cases.\n\n4. Regarding \"Borina\" in \"Therapeutic drug name\", this should be a therapeutic drug for the patient's specific gene mutation. Continuing treatment with this drug is also mentioned in the treatment recommendation.\n\n5. The patient's \"admission date\" is July 16, 2019, but the dates of some examinations and diagnoses are after that, which indicates that the admission record may have been gradually improved over a period of time after the patient was admitted.\n\n6. Regarding the \"record date\" is August 13, 2021, which may be the recording time of this admission record or an important data point. However, since it has no specific classification, I have included it as part of the overall record in the optimized admission record instead of listing it separately.\n\n7. All the provided data points have been reflected in the optimized admission record and organized in a logical order so that doctors can have a clearer understanding of the patient's condition and treatment.

She was admitted to the hospital on November 29, 2018 because she was diagnosed with sarcomatoid carcinoma with liver and cerebral hemisphere metastasis. Genetic testing showed KRAS mutation (G213, Q61L), FGFR1 positive, EGFR exon 19 positive, MET exon 14 skipping mutation, TP53 positive, HER4 (ERBB4) positive, and HER2 (ERBB2) without exon 20 insertion. The patient's ECOG performance status was 2 and was evaluated on May 21, 2021. The patient also carried NTRK-fusion. In addition, the patient suffered from multiple underlying diseases, including stroke, hypertensive nephropathy, diabetes, human papillomavirus infection, empyema, and digestive system obstruction. The patient's first symptoms appeared on June 15, 2022, the first imaging diagnosis was confirmed on August 17, 2019, and the first treatment began on June 29, 2019, including surgical treatment. The patient underwent radiotherapy starting from August 3, 2020, to January 28, 2021. Further surgical interventions were performed targeting the liver metastasis and lung resection sites. During hospitalization, the patient received a personalized treatment plan, including targeted drug therapy and surgical treatment tailored to the characteristics of his disease. Immunoassays found that the PDL1 expression level was at a low level, the IC score was also low, and the CPS score did not exceed the medium level, which may have affected the patient's response to immunotherapy. Based on the patient's clinical manifestations, imaging examinations, genetic testing, and immune test results, we adopted a plan of surgery as the main treatment supplemented by targeted drug therapy. The surgical site was the liver metastasis site, the operation was successful, and the patient recovered well. The treatment drugs included TKI drugs for EGFR mutations and targeted drugs for MET mutations. Treatment began on September 20, 2022, and the patient was discharged on December 11, 2018 after completing the treatment cycle. The patient was in a stable condition at the time of discharge, and continuous follow-up and monitoring for signs of disease recurrence or progression are recommended. After discharge, patients should continue to receive targeted therapy drugs and adjust the treatment plan according to the follow-up results. At the same time, regular examinations and treatments are recommended for patients' underlying diseases to control their impact on lung cancer treatment. Patients should maintain a healthy lifestyle, eat a healthy diet, and exercise appropriately to improve their quality of life and prognosis.json output:",

The patient has multiple bad living habits, including long-term smoking and drinking, and there are lung cancer patients in the family. According to the pathological examination on July 31, 2021, the patient was diagnosed with microinvasive adenocarcinoma. In addition to basic respiratory diseases such as bullae, the patient also has multi-system chronic diseases such as hypertensive nephropathy, heart failure, and ulcerative colitis, and the condition is complicated. In genetic testing, the patient showed multiple gene variations such as EGFR20 positivity, ALK amplification and point mutation, ROS1 S1986F mutation, MET c-MET overexpression, and MET14 jump. Immunoassay showed that PDL1 expression was 55%, IC score was 15, and TPS was 10%, which provided a theoretical basis for immunotherapy. The patient underwent the first lung resection on February 14, 2020, as well as subsequent targeted therapy. Considering that the patient's ECOG score is 3, it reflects that the patient's ability to carry out daily activities is limited and requires special care and treatment plans. After admission, the patient will receive a comprehensive evaluation and individualized treatment plan adjustment, including possible medication adjustments and symptomatic treatment. The current treatment plan includes targeted drug therapy for the patient's EGFR mutation and ALK mutation, and a chemotherapy regimen comprising Pemetrexed Disodium for Injection and Gemcitabine, initiated on June 3, 2020, and concluded on February 16, 2021. The patient's physical condition and medical history will be fully considered in the design of the treatment plan in order to achieve the best efficacy and quality of life.

She was first diagnosed with mixed non-small cell lung cancer and non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma on January 14, 2018, and the pathological type was determined to be colloid adenocarcinoma and solid adenocarcinoma. Since the first diagnosis, the patient has undergone a series of genetic tests and was found to have RET fusion positivity, MET amplification and MET14 loss, BRAF positivity, BRCA2 mutation, RB1 positivity, TP53 positivity, NTRK positivity, and HER2 (ERBB2) non-20 insertion. Immunological testing showed that the patient's immune phenotype was PDL1 expression level 10%, TPS value 10%, CPS value 10%, and immune cell infiltration (IC) of the tumor microenvironment was 10%. The patient's ECOG score was 4, which means that the condition is relatively serious, the general condition is extremely poor, and the patient is completely bedridden, unable to take care of himself, unable to perform any activities, and completely dependent on others for care. \n\nDuring the patient's treatment, we adopted a thoracic perfusion treatment plan and first implemented drug treatment on November 25, 2019. Treatment drugs include drugs commonly used in the field of lung cancer, such as targeted therapy drugs and chemotherapy drugs. A specific treatment plan was initiated with Mitoxantrone on July 30, 2020, and concluded on July 8, 2021. As the treatment progressed, the patient experienced brain metastases, including cerebral hemisphere metastases and brainstem metastases, showing the progression and deterioration of the disease. Specifically, imaging confirmed a Cerebellar metastasis on November 7, 2021.\n\nThe patient also suffered from multiple other systemic diseases, including urticaria, pulmonary edema, Alzheimer's disease, diarrhea, luminal stenosis, and macular degeneration, which affected the patient's overall condition and treatment options. The patient was admitted to the hospital mainly for routine treatment evaluation and disease monitoring. The admission date was August 10, 2024, during which necessary treatment and care were carried out. After comprehensive evaluation and treatment by the medical staff of our department, the patient was discharged today (recorded date December 2, 2022). At the time of discharge, the patient's general condition was still stable, but he needed to continue to receive supportive treatment and symptom relief treatment at home. Discharge instructions include: regular follow-up examinations, a strict drug treatment plan, and necessary life care and support. In order to ensure that the patient can be properly cared for at home, we will provide detailed nursing instructions and drug usage instructions. At the same time, we will also follow up with the patient by phone regularly to monitor changes in the condition and ensure the treatment effect of the patient in a non-hospital environment. We recommend that patients and their families keep in close contact with us and seek medical attention immediately if any discomfort or worsening of symptoms occur. In short, although the patient's current condition is more serious and complicated, we believe that through continuous medical monitoring and treatment, the progression of the disease can be controlled to a certain extent and the patient's quality of life can be improved.json output:",

        "input": "According to medical data, the patient Lei Guiqin suffered from right lung adenocarcinoma and had undergone liver cancer resection surgery on 2021-01-25. The first symptoms appeared on 2021-04-26. The HER4 (ERBB4) test result was positive, and the RET test result showed the presence of fusion. She also had a history of liver cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\n\nIn the body of the report, existing studies have shown that patients with positive MRD (molecular residual disease) test in peripheral blood after treatment have a poor prognosis. In a clinical study of stage I-llI lung cancer, a total of 40 patients were included, including 33 NSCLC patients, 7 SCLC patients, 7 stage IB patients, and 33 stage II-III patients. Plasma ctDNA was tested at multiple follow-up nodes in 37 patients after treatment, of which 20 patients tested positive for ctDNA at least in one follow-up node, and all of these patients relapsed. Statistics of 32 patients with first-node plasma samples within 4 months after treatment showed a ctDNA detection rate of 53%, a 36-month free progression rate (FFP) of 0% in the ctDNA-positive group, and a 36-month free progression rate (FFP) of 93% in the ctDNA-negative group, with a hazard ratio of 43.4.\n\nIn addition, a clinical study (TRACERx) for early non-small cell lung cancer showed that a total of 24 patients were included in the study of the predictive value of postoperative ctDNA detection for recurrence risk, of which the recurrence rate in the ctDNA-positive group was 93% and the recurrence rate in the ctDNA-negative group was 10%. Dynamic detection of ctDNA can analyze the subclonal evolution of recurrent NSCLC, evaluate the response to adjuvant therapy, and provide guidance for personalized treatment before clinical recurrence.\n\nIn summary, MRD detection is of great significance in the prognosis evaluation and personalized treatment of lung cancer patients, and can guide the consolidation of treatment strategies and improve the treatment effect of patients. The detection results of MRD should be considered in combination with the specific clinical conditions of the patient, and should not be used as the sole basis for guiding clinical decision-making. json results:",

Further treatment included targeted and pericardial perfusion.\nIn 2020, the patient reported that his condition worsened and he received ritoprazole*8 cycles, OPDIVO*8 cycles, the specific end time is February 2021; no obvious mutations were found in genetic testing.\nAfter taking the oral targeted drug anlotinib in July 2021, symptoms of decreased appetite and hypertension appeared.\nA reexamination in October 2021 showed that multiple nodules were newly found in both brains, which were considered to be metastases. On October 10 of the same year, chest CT showed that multiple metastases in both lungs and pleura had progressed, with bilateral pleural thickening and enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum. There were high-density shadows inside thoracic vertebrae 8 and thoracic vertebrae 10, with no significant changes compared with the previous ones.\nOn November 5, 2021, blood gene testing was performed again, and EGFR19 deletion mutations were found. HER3 (ERBB3) is positive, STK11 is positive.\nOn December 9, 2021, osimertinib was used for treatment for one month, and on December 7 The chest CT scan (No. 216921) reviewed on August 13 showed changes after right lower lobectomy. There were patchy and nodular fuzzy shadows in both lungs, which were consistent with changes after metastatic treatment. Bullae appeared in both lungs, and the 7th group of mediastinal lymph nodes were slightly larger (17x9mm), which required further investigation. A small amount of pleural effusion on the right side. Multiple bone metastases need to be analyzed in combination with bone scan. The head MRI showed multiple brain metastases, some of which may be accompanied by bleeding, and the efficacy was assessed as partial remission (PR).\nOn August 13, 2022, the brain enhanced MRI showed that most of the multiple brain metastases disappeared, and the remaining small enhancement foci did not change much compared with the previous time. On August 22, the comprehensive abdominal ultrasound showed that there was no significant change in the bilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes compared with May 18, 2022. The results of the chest enhanced CT scan reviewed on August 28 were roughly unchanged compared with the previous time.\nOn November 30, 2022, the condition was stable.\nOn February 19, 2023, the chest enhanced CT was re-examined, and the results showed changes after right lower lobectomy. The metastasis of both lungs was partially the same as before and partially enlarged. The 7th group of mediastinal lymph nodes remained unchanged compared with the previous time. The small amount of pleural effusion on the right side was the same as the previous time, and the multiple bone metastases did not change. On February 21, the enhanced MRI of the head showed that the left frontal lobe enhancement focus was unclear this time, and the suspicious enhancement focus on the right temporal lobe was smaller and less enhanced than before.
